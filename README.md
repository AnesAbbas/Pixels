# Pixels
Because the internet is not always the friendliest of places for families, Pixels is a chrome extension that helps protect you and your family by blurring some of the images on a website.

User Guide: Once installed, pin the Pixels extension to your toolbar for easy access. To blur/unblur a website, simply click the extension's icon while visiting the page. 

Note: Pixels is just one line of defence, keep your good guard up!
